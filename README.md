# Raymarching
Raymarching is a technology for rendering scenes. It is interesting because the characteristics and positions of objects are described by formulas, which means you can render scenes in any resolution

## Third-party libraries 
For .png files saving, i'm used: https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng

## Features!

  - Multithreading
  - ASCII arts
  - Image saving in .png
  - Pre-created base figure classes
  - You can create your own figure (fractals too!)
  - You can create fractals
  - Automatic selection of the optimal number of threads (provided in example)
  - DESIGNED AND CODED IN RUSSIA(ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º)
  
## Todos

  - GPU support
  - Write custom .png saving

## Compiling
If you have a your_program.cpp that #includes and uses raymarching.h, you can build as follows:
```sh
g++ your_program.cpp -pthread
```
Example compiling and running (linux):
```sh
g++ -o main main.cpp -pthread; ./main
```
